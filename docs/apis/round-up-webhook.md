# Round Up

For a customer, take all the transactions in a given week and round them up to the nearest pound. For example with spending of £4.35, £5.20 and £0.87, the round-up would be £1.58. This amount should then be transferred into a [savings goal](https://www.starlingbank.com/blog/introducing-goals/), helping the customer save for future adventures.
